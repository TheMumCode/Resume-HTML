<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey!<br>
I'm TheMumCode, here's my not so fancy pants HTML <br>
resume that I'm doing via the AppBrewary and Angela Yu</p>

<p>I currently work as a Digital Marketing Trainer and would like to uplevel. <br>
   Previously I have built websites for clients via Wix, but would now like to 
   code websites for private clients and show my students this skill too. </p>
